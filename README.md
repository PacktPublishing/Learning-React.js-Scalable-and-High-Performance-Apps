## About the Video Course
It's one thing to build an app that runs well on your test system, but it's quite another to build an app that still performs well when it's live with thousands of users. This course will help you take your apps to the next professional level, while making sure they remain performant at scale. There are many aspects to optimizing your React applications, some that you can apply later, and others that need to be designed in from the beginning. This course will give you tips and advice for both.
Covering JavaScript, CSS, and React-specific tips and advanced techniques, this course will make sure that you can build highly optimized, production-ready applications. The course begins by looking at important considerations you should build in to the planning stage of your apps: making sure options are set correctly, getting the most from Webpack, and optimizing your application's dependencies. We then go on to look in detail at some of the new performance enhancements that ES6 brings, such as using let and const instead of vars and advanced memory management for strings. Next, we cover more general JavaScript performance optimizations, and using ExpressJS for fast server-side rendering. Finally, we examine how best to package up all of the individual parts of your application to achieve the smallest file sizes and smoothest caching.
